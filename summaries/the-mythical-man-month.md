### Intro
The Mythical Man-Month is a very outdated book, which does provide some, interestingly still applicable, insights into the programming world. It is written by Frederick Brooks — the father of the IBM system. It summarises the programming challenges of the time — the first edition from 1975, the second (the one I read) 20 years later from 1995.

### Why is writing an initial program from scratch so much faster than fixing a large one?

* no cross-program testing required
* less cross-system debugging
* less communication issues
* less people working on it (which creates managerial complexities — A LOT OF THEM — mostly training and communication)

### Why is programming fun?
sheer joy of making things
pleasure of making things that are useful to others
fascination of complex puzzle-like objects and watching them work
joy of always learning
delight of working with a tractable medium
### The Woes of programming?
* One must perform perfectly
* Other people set ones objectives
* Dependency on others (ie other programmers)
* Grand concepts are fun, nitty gritty bugs just work
* Last bugs are way harder to find than first ones
* Before you finish there’s usually already a better solution on the way

### Why does programming always take longer than assumed?

* We always assume that all will go well
* Effort does not equal Progress — they are not interchangeable
* Estimates are uncertain, so we don’t even try to stick to them
* Scheduled time is poorly monitored
* When schedules go over time, we add more manpower (which takes even more time)

### Key Takeaway

* More developers on same project does not solve the problem. Training and communication exacerbate the issue and makes it harder to work for everyone.
* The key is to split the work in bit sized modules between teams, who trust and can rely on each other through well organised communication channels.
